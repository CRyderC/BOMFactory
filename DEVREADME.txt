This is some helpful stuff you should know about what we're doing here.

This site is going to be using Next.js:https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started
It's React.js based: https://reactjs.org/
    React basically uses JavaScript to build the user interface, while
      Next.js is the wrapper around the whole thing we'll use for managing
      files, deploying, etc.

React is based on TypeScript:https://www.typescriptlang.org/
  Typescript is a SuperSet of Javascript (IIRC React and Tysecript are both creations 
  of Facebook). It compiles to pure Javascript  and has ways to embed JavaScript 
  in markup.

Read up on those to get started.

Thinking if we run a DB we'll use some sort of Open Source SQL thing like
  MySql or Sqlite. We don't have any real need for the database to be SuperSet
  light weight (or maybe we do? Depends what exactly we're trying to cache) some
  maybe not Sqlite. Although it's perfectly functional, it shines in embedded uses
  because it's so light.
